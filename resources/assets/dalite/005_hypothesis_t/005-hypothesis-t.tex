\begin{abstract}
This DALITE quiz will cover the bootstrap, an introduction to
significance testing, and inference for a single mean using the t
distribution. This will also cover the binomial distribution and
inference for a sample proportion. You need to understand the binomial
distribution before moving on to the chapter on one sample proportions.
This is analgous to learning the normal distribution before inference
for a single mean.

Completion of this DALITE exercise will be availble to us automatically
through the DALITE website. Therefore \textbf{you do not need to hand
anything in}. Marks will be based on the number of correct answers. For
each question you will receive 0.5 marks for getting the correct answer
on the first attempt and an additional 0.5 marks if you stick with the
right answer or switch to the correct answer after seeing someone else's
rationale. Recall that access to your assignments is managed through
tokens sent to your e-mail address. You will be sent a new link
everytime a new assignment has been posted.

\item
  Understand that the bootstrap can be used to simulate a sampling
  distribution
\item
  Confidence intervals can subsequently be calculated directly from the
  bootstrap distribution
\item
  Bootstrap confidence intervals do not rely on the Central Limit

\item
  Understand that a significance test answers the question ``Is this
  sample outcome good evidence that an effect is present in the
  population, or could it easily occur just by chance?''
\item
  Be able to formulate the null hypothesis and alternative hypothesis
  for tests about the mean of a population. Understand that the
  alternative hypothesis is the researcher's point of view.
\item
  Understand the concept of a p-value. Know that smaller p-values
  indicate stronger evidence against the null hypothesis.
\item
  Be able to calculate p-values as areas under a normal curve in the
  setting of tests about the mean of a normal population with known
  standard deviation.
\item
  Be able to test a population mean with a z-test.

\item
  Understand what a t-distribution is and how it differs from a normal
  distribution.
\item
  Know how to check whether the underlying assumptions for a t-test or
  t-confidence interval are reasonably satisfied.
\item
  Be able to calculate a t-confidence interval for a population mean.
\item
  Be able to test a population mean with a t-test. Be able to calculate
  the t-test statistic and to determine the p-value as an area under a
  t-density curve.
\item
  Be able to adapt one-sample t-procedures to analyze matched pairs
  data.
