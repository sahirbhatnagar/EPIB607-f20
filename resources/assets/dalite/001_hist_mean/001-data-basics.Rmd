# Abstract
abstract: |
  This DALITE quiz will cover the basic concepts of displaying and describing categorical and quantitative data such as histograms, mean, median, mode, five-number summary. It will cover more descriptives such as boxplots, standard deviation, and introduce you to normal density curves.

# Marking {-}

Completion of this DALITE exercise will be availble to us automatically through the DALITE website. Therefore **you do not need to hand anything in**. Marks will be based on the number of correct answers. For each question you will receive 0.5 marks for getting the correct answer on the first attempt and an additional 0.5 marks if you stick with the right answer or switch to the correct answer after seeing someone else's rationale.

# Displaying and Describing Numerical and Categorical Data

<!--
## Learning Objectives
1. Understand that the distribution of a variable consists of what values the variable takes and
how often.
2. Understand that class intervals should be of equal width; choose appropriate class widths
to effectively reveal informative patterns in the data.
3. Understand that the vertical axis of the histogram may be scaled for frequency, proportion,
or percentage. The choice of vertical scaling for any data set does not affect the important
features revealed by a histogram.
4. Be able to describe a graphical display of data by first describing the overall pattern and
then deviations from that pattern. Describe the shape of the overall pattern and identify any
gaps in data and potential outliers.
5. Recognize rough symmetry and clear skewness in the overall pattern of a distribution
