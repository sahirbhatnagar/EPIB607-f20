\begin{abstract}
This DALITE quiz will cover the basic concepts of displaying and
describing categorical and quantitative data such as histograms, mean,
median, mode, five-number summary. It will cover more descriptives such
as boxplots, standard deviation, and introduce you to normal density
curves.

% If your first paragraph (i.e. with the \dropcap) contains a list environment (quote, quotation, theorem, definition, enumerate, itemize...), the line after the list may have some extra indentation. If this is the case, add \parshape=0 to the end of the list environment.

Completion of this DALITE exercise will be availble to us automatically
through the DALITE website. Therefore \textbf{you do not need to hand
anything in}. Marks will be based on the number of correct answers. For
each question you will receive 0.5 marks for getting the correct answer
on the first attempt and an additional 0.5 marks if you stick with the
right answer or switch to the correct answer after seeing someone else's
rationale.
