\vspace*{1in}

Computing is an essential part of modern statistics. However, before doing any data analysis, we must first install the necessary tools. In this assignment you will first download R and RStudio and learn about what these tools are. Then you will signup for a free DataCamp account with your `mail.mcgill.ca` or `mcgill.ca` address. After this, you will be asked to complete a series of DataCamp courses that will guide you through some basic and some more advanced commands. You will then be introduced to R Markdown which is a tool for creating reproducible reports. All future assignments for this course must be submitted in R Markdown format. 

\newpage


# Marking 

Your progress and completion of these courses will be availble to us automatically through the DataCamp website. **You do not need to hand anything in for this Assignment**. You will receive full credits for this assignment once we have seen that all tasks have been completed.

# Install R and RStudio

[Chapter 5 of this free online book](https://datascienceineducation.com/c05.html) will guide you through installing both [R](https://cran.r-project.org/) and [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/preview/). RStudio is a software application that facilitates how you interact with `R`. 


# Sign up for DataCamp

Sign up for a free DataCamp account at [this link](https://datacamp.com/groups/shared_links/779fb8c2bb178eb6936c93109a0efa66ad3a3519a4657ac1b5f70be80fa87718). Note: you are required to sign up with a `@mail.mcgill.ca` or `@mcgill.ca` email address.  




# Required Courses to Complete

Once you have registered for DataCamp, you will see a series of courses that have been assigned. These are required to complete by September 1, 2020.

1. Introduction to `R`
2. Introduction to Importing Data in `R`
3. Exploratory Data Analysis in `R`
4. Introduction to the Tidyverse
5. Introduction to Data Visualization with `ggplot2`
6. Reporting wiht `R Markdown`


# Optional Courses

The following courses are optional. You may find them helpful in strengthening your knowledge of `R`.

1. Working with Data in the Tidyverse
2. Data manipulation with `dplyr`
3. Intermediate Data Visualization with `ggplot2`
4. Joining Data with `dplyr`
5. Data Cleaning in `R`



## Interactive R Learning Environment with Swirl (Optional)

`swirl` is a software package for the R programming language that turns the R console into an interactive learning environment. Users receive immediate feedback as they are guided through self-paced lessons in data science and R programming. Students from previous years found this to be extremely helpful in their path to learning `R`. Follow [instructions on this page](https://swirlstats.com/students.html) for how to get started.
