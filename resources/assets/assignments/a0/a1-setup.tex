Computing is an essential part of modern statistics. However, before
doing any data analysis, we must first install the necessary tools. In
this assignment you will first download R and RStudio and learn about
what these tools are. Then you will signup for a free DataCamp account
with your \texttt{mail.mcgill.ca} or \texttt{mcgill.ca} address. After
this, you will be asked to complete a series of DataCamp courses that
will guide you through some basic and some more advanced commands. You
will then be introduced to R Markdown which is a tool for creating
reproducible reports. All future assignments for this course must be
submitted in R Markdown format.

\newpage

\section{Marking}\label{marking}}

Your progress and completion of these courses will be availble to us
automatically through the DataCamp website. \textbf{You do not need to
hand anything in for this Assignment}. You will receive full credits for
this assignment once we have seen that all tasks have been completed.

\section{Install R and RStudio}\label{install-r-and-rstudio}}

\href{https://datascienceineducation.com/c05.html}{Chapter 5 of this
free online book} will guide you through installing both
\href{https://cran.r-project.org/}{R} and
\href{https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/preview/}{RStudio}.
RStudio is a software application that facilitates how you interact with
\texttt{R}.

Complete}\label{required-courses-to-complete}}

Once you have registered for DataCamp, you will see a series of courses
that have been assigned. These are required to complete by September 1,
2020.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Introduction to \texttt{R}
\item

The following courses are optional. You may find them helpful in
strengthening your knowledge of \texttt{R}.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Working with Data in the Tidyverse
\item
  Data manipulation with \texttt{dplyr}
\item
  Intermediate Data Visualization with \texttt{ggplot2}
\item
  Joining Data with \texttt{dplyr}
\item

\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{interactive-r-learning-environment-with-swirl-optional}{%
\subsection{Interactive R Learning Environment with Swirl
(Optional)}\label{interactive-r-learning-environment-with-swirl-optional}}

\texttt{swirl} is a software package for the R programming language that
turns the R console into an interactive learning environment. Users
receive immediate feedback as they are guided through self-paced lessons
in data science and R programming. Students from previous years found
this to be extremely helpful in their path to learning \texttt{R}.
Follow \href{https://swirlstats.com/students.html}{instructions on this
page} for how to get started.
