# (25 points) Immunogenicity of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine against SARS-CoV-2

This questions refers to the Lancet paper _Safety and immunogenicity of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine against SARS-CoV-2:a preliminary report of a phase 1/2, single-blind, randomised controlled trial_ by Folegatti et. al (2020) and available in myCourses. 

   a) (2 points) Consider Figure 3 Panel B: What visual cues (or aesthetics) are being used? Briefly describe the main takeaways from the entire Figure 3.
   b) (3 points) Do you think Figure 3 is a good graphic in terms of conveying its message clearly? Is there anything you would have done differently? Explain.
   c) (2 points) Consider the data introduced in class which contains immunity levels (Immunoglobulin G (IgG)) from the convalescent group and the vaccine groups post 28 days. Note that the IgG levels in the dataset below are given on the log10 scale. Calculate the median IgG levels (ELISA units) on the log10 scale for each group.

```{r}
path <-
"http://www.biostat.mcgill.ca/hanley/statbook/immunogenicityChAdOx1.nCoV-19vaccine.txt"
ds <- read.table(path)
head(ds)
str(ds)
```

  e) (1 point) Are you able to calculate a correlation of IgG levels between groups? If not, explain why not? If yes, interpret the correlation.
  d) (4 points) From the medians alone, is there enough evidence to conclude that the median IgG levels in the convalescent group are higher than the median IgG levels in the vaccine group (post 28 days)? Explain.
  e) (7 points) Use the Boostrap to asses if there is enough evidence to suggest that the median IgG levels in the convalescent group are higher than the median IgG levels in the vaccine group (post 28 days). _Hint: resample the data with replacement separately in each group B=1000 times. For each of the B datasets, calculate the median IgG level and take the difference in medians between the two groups. Plot the differences in a histogram and calculate the 2.5 and 97.5 percentiles._
f) (6 points) The dataset, shown below and available on myCourses, was extracted (approximately) from Figure 3 Panel A for the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (prime) group only. The `time` column represents the days since vaccination, and `igg_response` are the IgG levels on the original scale. Create an appropriate figure which shows the immunity levels as a function of time. You are free to choose the plot type; the choice of plot should be guided by the message you are trying to convey. Be sure to label your axes, show units, include a title and choose an appropriate color palette. Briefly interpret the plot.

# (25 points) COVID-19 Cases Comparison Between Counties With and Without Stay-at-Home Orders

This question is based on the JAMA Network Open article _Comparison of Estimated Rates of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Border Counties in Iowa Without a Stay-at-Home Order and Border Counties in Illinois With a Stay-at-Home Order_ by Lyu and Wehby (2020) and available in myCourses. The county and state level cumulative incidence of cases data is provided in the code below. Note: you need to install the `covdata` package (which is not on CRAN) using `remotes::install_github("kjhealy/covdata")`. 

```{r}
# remotes::install_github("kjhealy/covdata")
library(covdata) 
library(dplyr); library(tidyr); library(ggplot2); library(readr)
# get population data from https://covid19.census.gov/datasets/
f <- "https://opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/21843f238cbb46b08615fc53e19e0daf_1.csv"
pop_county <- read_csv(file = f) %>%
  dplyr::rename(fips = GEOID, population = B01001_001E, state = State) %>%
  dplyr::select(state, fips, population)

county_level <- nytcovcounty %>%
  dplyr::left_join(pop_county, by = c("state","fips")) %>%
  dplyr::mutate(cases.per.10k = cases/population * 1e4) %>%
  dplyr::filter(state %in% c("Iowa","Illinois")) %>%
  dplyr::group_by(county)

pop_state <- pop_county %>%
  dplyr::group_by(state) %>%
  dplyr::summarise(population = sum(population, na.rm = TRUE))

state_level <- county_level %>%
  dplyr::group_by(state, date) %>%
  dplyr::filter(date >= "2020-03-15") %>%
  dplyr::summarise(cases = sum(cases)) %>%
  dplyr::left_join(pop_state, by = "state") %>%
  dplyr::mutate(cases.per.10k = cases / population * 1e4, state = factor(state),
                time = as.numeric(date - min(date)) + 1)
```


```{r}
head(county_level)
head(state_level)
```


a) (6 points) Using the county level dataset provided, reproduce Figure 1 of the paper. Does your Figure agree with theirs? Would county level curves have been more appropriate to show instead of the state totals?
b) (5 points) Plot the cumulative incidence curves per 10000 people from March 21 until the most recent day for which you have data, for each of the counties used in the paper. Interpret the plot and discuss if the county level plots still agree with the overall conclusion of the paper. 
b) (4 points) Case counts are inherently tied to testing capacity. Death from COVID19 doesn't have this issue, although there are other biases such as misclassification and under reporting. Plot the same graph as in part (b) but for deaths and interpret the plot.
d) (10 points) Illinois (Democrat-controlled legislature) is surrounded by states with [Republican-controlled legislatures (Iowa, Missouri, Kentucky, Indianna, Wisconsin)](https://www.ncsl.org/research/about-state-legislatures/partisan-composition.aspx#). Do the data suggest there is a correlation between COVID-19 cases (or deaths) and which party has legislative control? Explain and justify using summary statistics and/or figures. Do not overcomplicate this analysis, i.e., feel free to make simplifying assumptions about testing.

# (25 points) Age-structures of Populations, then and now

The 1911 census of Ireland was taken on April 2nd 1911 and was released to the public in 1961. Follow [this link](http://www.census.nationalarchives.ie/help/about19011911census.html) for further details on the census. James Hanley (JH) has scrapped the data for Dublin, collected the age-frequency distribtion by gender and provided you with a three column .csv file on myCourses called `age_sex_frequencies_ireland.csv` which looks like this:

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
cens <- read.csv("age_sex_frequencies_ireland.csv")
```


```{r, echo=2}
cens <- read.csv("~/git_repositories/EPIB607/resources/assets/assignments/a1/data/age_sex_frequencies_ireland.csv")
head(cens)
```

The `Age` column represents the age in 1911. The `Freq` column gives the frequency of the number of people for a given age and `Gender`. Note that `Age` is an interval; for example, `Age=0` actually represents individuals who are between the ages of 0 and 1, `Age=1` are individuals between ages 1 and 2, and so on. 

  a) (6 points) What was the earliest year of birth for (i) males and (ii) females ?
  b) (8 points) Create a suitable visualization of this data and then comment on any patterns you see and give reasons for these patterns. Your choice should leverage all the information provided in the data and be influenced by the message that you are trying to convey. Be sure to include an informative title and figure caption. 
  c) (8 points) Calculate the mean age, the standard deviation (SD), and the quartiles: $Q_{25}, Q_{50} (median), Q_{75}$ separately for males and females.
  d) (3 points) The original census cards have been scanned are available online. [This one in particular](http://www.census.nationalarchives.ie/reels/nai000230598/) is quite famous. Why?

# (25 points) Flint Blood Lead Levels

Lead in the environment is persistent, bio-accumulative, and toxic. Chronic exposure to lead in children is associated with many negative health outcomes even when the Blood Lead Levels (BLLs) are measured as low as 1.0-10.0 µg/dL. An analysis of childhood exposure to lead is described in the article _Blood Lead Levels of Children in Flint, Michigan: 2006-2016_ by Gomez et al. (2018) available on myCourses.  

  a) (2 points) Summarize the main findings of the study in 280 characters or less. 
    
  b) (5 points) Does Figure 1 do a good job of conveying its message? Explain why or why not.
    
  c) (6 points) Consider the information presented in Figure 1 and think about the dataset which would have been used to generate the plot. What are the rows and what are the columns? What is the dimension of the dataset? Are the data in tidy format?
    

  d) (6 points) From the graph, extract the yearly BLL percentages $\geq$ 5.0 $\mu$g/dL, in children 5 years and younger, for Flint and Michigan. You may read directly off the graph or try using a [WebPlotDigitizer](https://automeris.io/WebPlotDigitizer/). Calculate the yearly change from baseline (2006) percentages separately for each group. Is there evidence to suggest that the change from baselines are different for Flint vs. Michigan? Support your answer with summary statistics and/or a plot. 

  e) (6 points) Figure 2 shows the geometric mean BLL levels over time for children residing within Flint boundaries. Recreate the plot and add the simple linear regression line. Calculate the correlation coeffecient $r$ and compare it with the linear regression output. Do the results agree?

# Number of Authors

Fletcher et al. (1979, NEJM 301:180-183) studied the characteristics of 612 randomly selected articles published in the NEJM, JAMA, and the Lancet since 1946. Two characteristics examined were the number of authors per article and the number of students studied in each article:

```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
knitr::kable(as.data.frame(rbind(c("1946", "151","2.0 (1.4)","25"),
                                 c("1956", "149","2.3 (1.6)","36"),
                                 c("1966", "157","2.8 (1.2)","16"),
                                 c("1976", "155","4.9 (7.3)","30"))),
             col.names = c("Year","No. articles studied", "No. Authors Mean (SD)","No. subjects Median"),
             booktabs = TRUE)
```


  a) Why report median number of subjects (instead of average)?
  b) In 1976, can the standard deviation of 7.3 really be larger than the mean of 4.9? Explain. 
  c) In light of (a) and (b), how would you present the data in this table?


# Cancer Deaths in the US

The American Cancer Society (ACS) recently published age-adjusted cancer death rates by cancer site and gender at this [link](https://www.cancer.org/research/cancer-facts-statistics/all-cancer-facts-figures/cancer-facts-figures-2017.html).

  a) In the figure [Trends in Age-adjusted Cancer Death Rates by Site, Males, US, 1930-2014 (PDF)](https://www.cancer.org/content/dam/cancer-org/research/cancer-facts-and-statistics/annual-cancer-facts-and-figures/2017/trends-in-age-adjusted-cancer-death-rates-by-site-males-us-1930-2014.pdf) list the scales being used and the variable that has been mapped onto them. 
  b) Briefly comment on what you like about the figure, and what could have been improved (e.g. aesthetics, labels, use of color) 
  c) The data used to make the figures has also been provided on the ACS website in Excel spreasheets: [[males]](https://www.cancer.org/content/dam/cancer-org/research/cancer-facts-and-statistics/annual-cancer-facts-and-figures/2017/age-adjusted-cancer-death-rates-males-1930-2014.xlsx), [[females]](https://www.cancer.org/content/dam/cancer-org/research/cancer-facts-and-statistics/annual-cancer-facts-and-figures/2017/age-adjusted-cancer-death-rates-females-1930-2014.xlsx). Once you have downloaded the spreadsheets, the following code can be used to combine both datasets:

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
males <- readxl::read_xlsx("~/Downloads/age-adjusted-cancer-death-rates-males-1930-2014.xlsx", 
                           skip = 1, n_max = 85) %>% mutate(Gender = "Male")  
females <- readxl::read_xlsx("~/Downloads/age-adjusted-cancer-death-rates-females-1930-2014.xlsx", 
                             skip = 1, n_max = 85) %>% mutate(Gender = "Female")
cancer_rates <- dplyr::bind_rows(list(females,males))
head(cancer_rates)
```

In order to make the data ready for plotting, we need to _melt_ it first:

```{r}
library(tidyr)
cancer_rates_melt <- tidyr::gather(cancer_rates, key = "Site", value = "Rate", -Year, -Gender)
head(cancer_rates_melt, n = 10)
```

Plot the data using a graph of your choice with the goal of comparing males vs. females. (you might consider using the function `gf_line` from the `ggformula` package). Briefly comment on your comparison. Be sure to include an informative title and figure caption.  

```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
gf_line(Rate ~ Year | Gender, data = cancer_rates_melt, color = ~ Site)

gf_boxplot(Rate ~ Site | Gender, data = cancer_rates_melt)

```



# Does breast-feeding weaken bones?

Breast-feeding mothers secrete calcium into their milk. Some of the calcium may come from their bones, so mothers may lose bone mineral content. Researchers compared 47 breast-feeding women with 22 women of similar age who were neither pregnant nor lactating. They measured the percent change in the mineral content of the women's spines over three months. The data can be read into R:

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
boneloss <- read.csv("https://github.com/sahirbhatnagar/EPIB607/raw/master/data/boneloss.csv")
head(boneloss)
```

A negative value of `mineral_loss` indicates a loss in mineral content. Do the data show distinctly greater bone mineral loss among the breast-feeding women? Use descriptive statistics, plots and/or tables to justify your conclusion.  



```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
dat <- read.table("~/git_repositories/epib607/data/boneloss.txt", header = FALSE)
library(dplyr)
dat <- dat %>% mutate(V1 = case_when(V1 == 1 ~ "Other", V1 == 2 ~ "Breast-feeding"))
colnames(dat) <- c("type", "mineral_loss")
write.csv(dat, file = "data/boneloss.csv", quote = FALSE, row.names = FALSE)

gf_boxplot(mineral_loss ~ type , data = dat, fill =~ type)
library(rmarkdown)
draft("mypaper.Rmd", template="pdf", package="pinp", edit=TRUE)

```



# Food in America

Vox published a list of [Charts that explain food in America](http://www.vox.com/a/explain-food-america). There are 40 maps, charts, and graphs that show where our food and drink comes from and how we eat it.

Pick your best and least favorite graphic, and briefly explain why using the taxonomy we learned in [class](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1wXgcTzcRKl_leGRfNZjWWPkjwJSTlZSXBCl-fFuLEaE/edit?usp=sharing) and provide a link to the figure. For example, this link: [Figure 18](https://www.vox.com/a/explain-food-america#list-21) was created using the following code: ```[Figure 18](https://www.vox.com/a/explain-food-america#list-21)```


<!-- 
We support several options via the YAML header

- Setting a DOI or URL footer, for example for the CRAN package URL,
  which is placed in the bottom-left footer of the title page and even pages;
- Setting a footer label, for example _YourPackage Vignette_ stating
  your package, which is placed in the bottom-right footer on odd
  pages;
- Setting a free-form author field used on the inside footer;
- Optional _Draft_ watermarking;



## References 

Here we differ from PNAS and suggest natbib. References will appear in
author-year form. Use `\citet{}`, `\citep{}`, etc as usual.

We default to the `jss.bst` style. To switch to a different bibliography
style, please use `biblio-style: style` in the YAML header.


## Inline R Code 

The PNAS sample included a fixed PNG image here, but this document prefers
to show the results and embedding of _R_ code. 

```{r figex, fig.width=3, fig.height=3, cache=TRUE, echo=TRUE, fig.cap="Narrow ggplot2 figure"}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(mtcars, aes(wt, mpg)) +
    geom_point(size=3, aes(colour=factor(cyl))) +
    theme(legend.position="none")
```

Here we use a standard knitr bloc with explicit options for

- figure width and height (`fig.width`, `fig.height`), both set to three inches;
- whether the code is shown (`echo=TRUE`); and
- the caption (`fig.cap`) as shown above.


## Digital Figures 

Markdown, Pandoc and LaTeX support `.eps` and `.pdf` files.

Figures and Tables should be labelled and referenced in the standard way
using the `\label{}` and `\ref{}` commands.

The R examples above show how to insert a column-wide
figure. To insert a figure wider than one column, please use the
`\begin{figure*}...\end{figure*}` environment. 

One (roundabout) way of doing this is to _not_ actually plot a figure, but to
save it in a file as the following segment shows:

```{r densityPlot, echo=TRUE}
library(ggplot2)
p <- ggplot(data = midwest,
            mapping = aes(x = area,
                          fill = state,
                          color = state)) +
    geom_density(alpha = 0.3)
## save to file
suppressMessages(ggsave("densities.pdf", p))
```

This file is then included via standard LaTeX commands.

\begin{figure*}
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=0.66\textwidth, height=3.5in]{densities} 
  \end{center}
  \caption{Wide ggplot2 figure}\label{fig}
\end{figure*}


## Typeset Code (But Do Not Run It) 

We can also just show code.

```r
xx <- faithful[,"eruptions"]
fit <- density(xx)
plot(fit)
```

This simply used a pandoc bloc started and ended by three backticks,
with `r` as the language choice.  Similarly, _many_ other languages
can be typeset directly simply by relying on pandoc.


## Single column equations 

Authors may use 1- or 2-column equations in their article, according to
their preference.

To allow an equation to span both columns, options are to use the
`\begin{figure*}...\end{figure*}` environment mentioned above for
figures, or to use the `\begin{widetext}...\end{widetext}` environment
as shown in equation \ref{eqn:example} below.

Please note that this option may run into problems with floats and
footnotes, as mentioned in the [cuted package
documentation](http://texdoc.net/pkg/cuted). In the case of problems
with footnotes, it may be possible to correct the situation using
commands `\footnotemark` and `\footnotetext`.

\begin{equation}
  \begin{aligned}
(x+y)^3&=(x+y)(x+y)^2\\
       &=(x+y)(x^2+2xy+y^2) \\
       &=x^3+3x^2y+3xy^3+x^3. 
       \label{eqn:example} 
  \end{aligned}
\end{equation}


pandoc writes all tables using longtable, which fails in 2-column mode
